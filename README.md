# fluctur-store

![alt text](Fluctur-Store.png)

This project is an e-commerce store created using the following:

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

It is a current work in progress as I am adding features to the store to make it intuative & easy to use. Also, I am collecting product information to seed to the database to showcase the scale of the application as well as learning to work with a production project which would have a real database with potentially thousands of products.
